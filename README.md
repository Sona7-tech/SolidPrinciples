# Solid -java

By following these Solid principles, you create more flexible, maintainable code. They encourage clean
OOP practices, such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or
responsibility

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extention but closed
for modification

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness
of the program . LSP is more related to class inheritance

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low - level modules. Both should depend on
abstractions(interfaces)
